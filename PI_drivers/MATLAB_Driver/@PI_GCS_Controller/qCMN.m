function [dValues] = qCMN(c,szAxes)
%   DESCRIPTION
%   Get  the  minimum  commandable  closed-loop  target  of  szAxes.  The  physical  unit  and  hence  the
%   interpretation  of  the  value  depend  on  the  closed-loop  control  mode  which  is  selected  for  the  axis (see 
%   CMO() for selection).
%
%   SYNTAX
%       [dValues] = PIdevice.qCMN(szAxes)
% 
%   INPUT
%       szAxes (char array)         string with axes
%
%   OUTPUT
%       [dValues] (double array)    array to receive the minimum commandable closed-loop target of the axes in physical units.
