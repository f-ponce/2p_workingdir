function CTV(c,szAxes,dValues)
%   DESCRIPTION
%   Set absolute closed-loop target for szAxes. Moves the given axes. All axes start moving simultaneously.
%   Servo must be enabled for all commanded axes prior to using this command. The selected closed-loop 
%   control mode (see CMO()) determines the variable which is controlled with 
%   CTV() (e.g. position or velocity or force).
